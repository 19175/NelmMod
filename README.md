# NelmMod
A Mod for the game NeverEnding Legacy by Ortiel. I am experimenting so it will probably fail.


Hi!
This is a repository for all of my mods I make for the game NeverEnding Legacy By Orteil. You can find it here: https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/

I will add more information as I go for each mod and what it does.

data.js - This is the default data set for the main game. I use it to test that Github and Jsdelivr still work with the game modding system. Pastebin used to work but since chrome started forcing MIMEs it failed.

technacy.js - this is a tech mod attempt. Also the main testing one and the first. Name is subject to change.
